# Development resources for iOS and Android Platform

We have prepared comprehensive development resources for the iOS and Android platforms. The development kit covers hardware connection, data analysis, Affective Cloud connection, and UI controls. SDKs are all packaged independently, and you can use them on demand according to the actual needs of your own app development.

Our SDK is fully packaged, and you can quickly start development with the help of SDK. The SDK also provides a lot of personalized customization functions. You can view the API documentation of each SDK for detailed customization APIs.
